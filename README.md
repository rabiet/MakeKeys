MakeKeys was created to add media key functionality to keyboards without the given keys!


    Current Hotkeys are:
      CTRL + Alt + 
        HOME:     Play/Pause
        END:      Stop
        PageUp:   Previous
        PageDown: Next


The keys are arranged like that to match the layout of the Surface Book!

To install, simply run the .exe once as administrator.

An autostart-Registry entry will be created and the file will be copied to %appdata%\MakeKeys\
